## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid Layout



### What I learned

I initially felt I wouldn't be able to accomplish it. But once I started thinking about what the layout should be, I was able to develop something that was near to the solution.
MDN documentation aided me along the way.

A few difficulties I encountered: horizontal and vertical item centering.
How do we center it without the thing bouncing about and shrinking?


```
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - Had the snippet from here.



### Continued development

I need a bit more practice with the flexbox.



### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me revise some snippet. Very easy to comprehend.
